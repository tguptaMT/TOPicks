There has been an interesting shift in how different news media organizations have  engaged with social media platforms over the last 5-6 years. My preliminary exploratory analysis of 15 major news media organizations like ABC, CNN, New York Times, Washington Post, Fox News, BBC etc. from 2012-2017 indicates a major strategic restructuring in these organizations with the goal of driving readership and advertisement revenue through social media platforms like Facebook. This is done primarily by posting web-links that redirect web-traffic from social media platforms, Facebook in this case, back to their source websites.

It's a highly competitive market and the content-makers are under constant pressure to create new content on topics people are interested in. However, there are very few empirical indicators of what sort of topics would actually drive reader attention in this crowded marketspace. If you go to Google search and type: "what should I write about" - you'll see hundreds of suggestions with catchy title like "10 hot topics you should write about". In fact, if you were to then go to Google Trend and check various versions of "topic to write about" or "what should I write about" etc., you'll see that content-makers from all over the world have been periodically searching for content ideas online. However, the popularity of these topics varies temporally and the static hard-coded suggestions in web articles or trial-and-error approaches are less than optimal. __TOPicks is a topic recommender and consumer-interest forecasting tool that employs natural language processing for topic clustering and builds on powerful machine learning algorithms for predicting what kind of consumer-interest your candidate topics of interest are likely to generate over the next few weeks__
